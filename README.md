# Custom Product Text Plugin

## Description

The Custom Product Text Preview Plugin allows users to add custom text to WooCommerce products. This plugin is designed specifically for a client who wanted to allow customers to personalize their clothing products with custom text and allow them to preview how the text might look on the product. While it currently doesn't offer extensive customization options, it meets the basic requirement of allowing customers to preview personalized text on a product.

## Features

- Adds a checkbox option to product variations that enables the custom text preview feature.
- When checked, preview option inputs become available for product variations. Each variation can have any number of preview options.
- Each preview option can be set as either a text input field, or a dropdown. A text input will allow a customer to enter anything they wish, and that text will be rendered on the image and a dropdown allows you to define a specific set of text options that will be rendered to the preview image.
- The label fields defines the input label for the preview option and the description field will render text above the input.
- There are font size and font color inputs for each preview option that define the color and font size of the rendered text.
- The "Render on Circle" checkbox will render the text on a half-circle with a width and position defined in the global plugin settings. Useful for text rendered beneath a circular logo or something similar.
- The "User Selected Font" option allows the customer to decide what font they would like for the product personalization.
- The product image field defines what image the text will be rendered over.
- Last, the global settings page defines the X and Y coordinates where the text is rendered as well as the circle width and the maximum length of text a customer can enter.
